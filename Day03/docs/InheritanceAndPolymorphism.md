### **Inheritance and Polymorphism in Java (with Detailed Concepts)**

#### **1. Inheritance**

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class to inherit fields and methods from another class. In Java, inheritance provides a mechanism for code reuse, allowing a new class (subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors of an existing class (superclass).

#### **Key Concepts in Inheritance**:
- **Superclass (Parent Class)**: The class whose properties (fields and methods) are inherited by another class.
- **Subclass (Child Class)**: The class that inherits the properties of the superclass. It can also have additional methods and properties.
- **`extends` keyword**: Used to specify that a class inherits from another class.
- **Single Inheritance**: Java supports single inheritance, where a class can only inherit from one superclass.
- **Method Overriding**: When a subclass provides its own implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass.

#### **Example**:
```java
class Animal { // Superclass
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal { // Subclass
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

In the example above, `Dog` inherits the `sound()` method from `Animal` and overrides it with its own implementation.

### Types of inheritance in Java represented using diagrams:

#### **1. Single Inheritance**
```
         Animal
            |
          Dog
          / \
    makeSound makeSound
```

#### **2. Multilevel Inheritance**
```
         Animal
            |
          Dog
            |
         Puppy
          / \
    makeSound makeSound
```

#### **3. Hierarchical Inheritance**
```
         Animal
       /        \
    Dog         Cat
    / \        /   \
  makeSound makeSound
```

#### **4. Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces)**
```
         Animal
         /    \
        Dog    Cat
         |      |
        Pet    Pet
        / \    / \
    makeSound makeSound
```

#### **5. Hybrid Inheritance (Combination of Multiple and Multilevel)**
```
         Animal
         /   \
       Dog    Cat
         |     |
        Puppy   Kitten
        / \     / \
    makeSound makeSound
```

Note: Java does not support multiple inheritance directly through classes to avoid ambiguity, but it can be achieved through interfaces, as shown in the Multiple Inheritance diagram.

### **2. Polymorphism**

Polymorphism is another key concept in OOP that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. The term "polymorphism" means "many shapes" and refers to the ability of different classes to provide their own implementation of methods that are defined in a parent class.

#### **Types of Polymorphism in Java**:
1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**: Polymorphism that is resolved during compile time. Achieved via method overloading, where multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.
2. **Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**: Polymorphism that is resolved during run time. Achieved via method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

### **Deep Dive: Concepts Related to Polymorphism**

#### **1. Polymorphic Types**
A polymorphic type refers to a type that can refer to multiple types of objects at runtime. This typically happens with superclass references that can point to objects of subclass types.

```java
Animal animal = new Dog(); // Superclass reference points to subclass object
animal.sound(); // Outputs: "Dog barks"
```

In this example, `animal` is a polymorphic type because, at runtime, it can refer to an object of either the `Animal` or `Dog` type.

#### **2. Polymorphic References**
Polymorphic references occur when a variable of the parent class type refers to an object of the subclass type. This allows methods to be dynamically resolved at runtime, enabling run-time polymorphism.

```java
Animal a1 = new Dog();
Animal a2 = new Cat();
a1.sound(); // Outputs: "Dog barks"
a2.sound(); // Outputs: "Cat meows"
```

Here, both `a1` and `a2` are polymorphic references because they refer to objects of different subclasses (`Dog` and `Cat`) while having the type `Animal`.

#### **3. Polymorphic Arguments**
A polymorphic argument occurs when a method accepts parameters of a superclass type but can accept objects of any subclass type, providing flexibility.

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class AnimalTrainer {
    void trainAnimal(Animal a) { // Polymorphic argument
        a.makeSound();
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnimalTrainer trainer = new AnimalTrainer();
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        trainer.trainAnimal(dog); // Polymorphic argument, 'Animal' type accepts 'Dog'
    }
}
```

In this example, the `trainAnimal` method takes an `Animal` type argument, but it can accept `Dog` objects as well, due to polymorphism.

#### **4. Polymorphic Collections**
Polymorphism enables collections to store objects of different types while referring to them as their superclass type. This is often seen when using collections like `List`, where we can store objects of different subclasses.

```java
List<Animal> animals = new ArrayList<>();
animals.add(new Dog());  // Dog is an Animal
animals.add(new Cat());  // Cat is an Animal

for (Animal animal : animals) {
    animal.makeSound();  // Calls the overridden method in the appropriate subclass
}
```

Here, the list `animals` is polymorphic because it holds different subclass types (i.e., `Dog`, `Cat`) while treating them as `Animal`.

### **Compile-Time vs. Run-Time Polymorphism**

#### **1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**

- Method Overloading allows a class to have more than one method with the same name but different parameter lists.
- It is resolved at compile time, and the method to be called is determined based on the method signature (parameters).

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 3));        // Calls int version
        System.out.println(calc.add(5.0, 3.0));    // Calls double version
    }
}
```

#### **2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**

- Run-time polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation for a method defined in the superclass.
- It is resolved at runtime, and the method to be called is determined based on the actual object type, not the reference type.

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Polymorphic reference
        myDog.makeSound();  // Calls the overridden method in Dog
    }
}
```

|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Superclass**              | The parent class from which properties and methods are inherited.                                           |
| **Subclass**                | The child class that inherits from the superclass.                                                          |
| **Method Overloading**      | Multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists (compile-time polymorphism).               |
| **Method Overriding**       | Subclass provides its own implementation of a method already defined in the superclass (run-time polymorphism). |
| **Polymorphic Reference**   | A reference variable of a superclass type that points to an object of a subclass type.                      |
| **Polymorphic Argument**    | A method parameter that accepts objects of the superclass and all its subclasses.                           |
| **Polymorphic Collection**  | A collection that holds objects of different subclass types while treating them as instances of the superclass. |
| **`super` Keyword**         | Used to refer to the immediate superclass, often for invoking its methods or constructor.                   |
| **`this` Keyword**          | Refers to the current object.                                                                               |

### **Diagram: Polymorphism in Java**

```
         Animal
       /        \
    Dog         Cat
    / \        /   \
  makeSound  makeSound

Object: Animal a = new Dog();
At runtime: `a.makeSound()` calls Dog's implementation of `makeSound()`
```
