### **1. Abstraction in Java**

**Abstraction** is one of the fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows you to hide the implementation details and only expose the essential features of an object or system. In Java, abstraction is achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

#### **Key Points of Abstraction**:
- Focuses on "what" an object does, rather than "how" it does it.
- Abstract classes and interfaces provide a blueprint for subclasses or implementing classes, enforcing a contract to define essential behaviors without revealing implementation details.

#### **Abstract Class**: A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by subclasses.
```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();  // Abstract method (no body)
}
```

#### **Interface**: A completely abstract class that defines a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.
```java
interface Animal {
    void makeSound();  // Abstract method (no body)
}
```

#### **Diagram: Abstraction in Java (using Abstract Class)**

```
         Animal (Abstract Class)
       /        \
    Dog         Cat
    / \        /   \
  makeSound  makeSound
```

- **Animal** is an abstract class that provides the abstract method `makeSound()`.
- **Dog** and **Cat** are concrete subclasses that implement the `makeSound()` method.

### **2. Encapsulation in Java**

**Encapsulation** is the process of bundling data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). In encapsulation, the data is hidden from the outside world and can only be accessed through methods of the current class. This helps to protect the data from unintended modifications and ensures controlled access to class properties.

#### **Key Points of Encapsulation**:
- Data hiding is achieved using **private** access modifiers for variables, which are then accessed via **public getter and setter methods**.
- Encapsulation provides better control over data by restricting direct access.

#### **Example of Encapsulation**:
```java
class Dog {
    private String name;  // Private variable (data hiding)

    // Public getter method to access private data
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Public setter method to modify private data
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

#### **Diagram: Encapsulation in Java**

```
         Dog (Class)
        /         \
   private data    public methods
   - name        + getName()
                 + setName()
```

- **Dog** class encapsulates the `name` field, and this data can only be accessed or modified via the public `getName()` and `setName()` methods, enforcing data protection.

### **Difference Between Abstraction and Encapsulation**:

| **Feature**        | **Abstraction**                                    | **Encapsulation**                                         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**          | Focuses on hiding implementation details.          | Focuses on hiding data by controlling access to it.        |
| **Achieved Through** | Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.   | Achieved using classes with private variables and public methods. |
| **Purpose**        | To simplify complex systems by exposing only essential parts. | To protect the internal state of an object and provide controlled access. |
| **Example**        | Abstract class with abstract methods or an interface. | Class with private fields and public getters/setters.      |

These concepts are essential for building well-structured, secure, and modular software in Java.
